On Ubuntu:

1. VIM
Copy in .vimrc
Also need to install ctags
  sudo apt-get install ctags
Follow instructions at top of .vimrc - install Vundle and a Python 2 vim version

2. Docker Setup
Follow instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/
Sudo-fy the docker command with the following. (Use ec2-user for the Amazon Linux)
  sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu

3. Docker Usage
Cleanup old images with http://jimhoskins.com/2013/07/27/remove-untagged-docker-images.html

4. Django install
Install pip
  sudo apt install -y python-pip
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install django

5. Django project setup
Create project
  django-admin startproject <projectname>
  cd <projectname>
Edit the inbound rules for the security group for the server (in AWS manager web)
Edit settings.py to put the AWS server IP in ALLOWED_HOSTS
... then the test server can be run as follows.
  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Create the app
  python manage.py startapp <appname>
Initially I worked through this tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/
Cross site forgery protection means that an token is passed from the input form and
returned in the POST. As this doesn't apply here we need to (a) turn it off or (b) do soemthing
a bit cleverer. Trying (a) for now. Refer here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/csrf/
I commented out the 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' value in MIDDLEWARE in settings.py
OR use specific function decorators as per https://medium.com/@raiderrobert/how-to-make-a-webhook-receiver-in-django-1ce260f4efff

6. api.ai webhook setup
In api.ai, enable Webhook under "Fulfillment" on left menu (domains can remain disabled), 
then under same at bottom of intent page.
Make sure the AWS security group is set up to allow the api.ai ip (?) to access.
To test using curl (in Windows anyway) the command is of the form
  curl -X POST -T sampleQuery.txt http://w.x.y.z:8000/your/requesturl/
where sampleQuery.txt is a file with the json data.Then the json can be found in request.body
in the Django view.
